# Universe Vs Perception.MD

Both the many-worlds and quantum superposition coalescing theories are true. Our perception causes our 5D being to align with, or 'jump' to the universe whose vibrational frequency matches our perception. And our perception of reality quite literally becomes our new reality because we jump into the 5D (permutations of time) 'path' of the universe whose reality most closely matches our perception.

These mini vibration jumps are small, but over time they cause a butterfly effect. 

To change vibrational frequences, change your thinking, and do something you would not ordinarily do, and your perception will eventually change.

However you do not exist in a vacuum. Other people's perceptions and vibrations can also affect yours. If you notice someone at a low vibrational frequency and you do not wish to partake in theirs, you must change yours by isolating yourself, or otherwise taking time to reharmonize your pattern away from that frequency.

To approximate in your mind's eye how this works, "Everything everywhere all at once" is a good starting point.
